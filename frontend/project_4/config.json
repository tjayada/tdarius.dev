  "abstract": "I took part in the Braincraft challenge, which is a competition to design a biologically inspired, rate-based neural network capable of solving simple decision tasks. I went with an evolutionary algorithm to find the best network. To speed things up I have used multiprocessing and for the evaluation of the population I'm using a handcrafted reward function.",
