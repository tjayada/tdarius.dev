  "abstract": "A Python script that solves a sudoku puzzle using computer vision. Once the position of the sudoku is determined, number-templates are being matched with different scaling factors. The number with the most matches will be mapped into a 9x9 array. Afterwards a simple recursive algorithm solves the sudoku and the solution gets printed out.",
